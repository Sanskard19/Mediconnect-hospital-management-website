# Mediconnect-hospital-management-website
As part of my Semester 1 Applied Science & Engineering Project, my team and I designed and developed Mediconnect, a comprehensive hospital management application aimed at streamlining hospital operations and enhancing patient care. We observed how many hospitals still rely on outdated or fragmented systems that lead to inefficiencies, delays, and reduced quality of service. Mediconnect was our attempt to provide a unified, digital solution that could handle core hospital functions like patient data entry, appointment scheduling, prescription tracking, and billing â€” all through a user-friendly interface. The system supports multiple user roles (patients, doctors, pharmacists) with secure access to relevant data and real-time synchronization across departments.

We built the backend using Django and MySQL, ensuring robust data handling and secure user management. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and designed with Figma to create clean and intuitive layouts for mobile and desktop interfaces. We also integrated the Willow API to send automated SMS notifications for appointment reminders and medication updates, which added real-world utility. Our agile development approach allowed us to improve features continuously based on user feedback, including insights from healthcare professionals within our network. Mediconnect can be deployed on both cloud and on-premise servers, and future updates aim to include insurance handling, advanced analytics, and AI-driven medical suggestions.
